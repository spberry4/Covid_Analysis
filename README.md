# Covid_Analysis

When a virus replicates its genetic makeup can be slightly changed randomly due to insertions, deletions, or recombinations. These mutations don't usually cause too much of a change in the virus but occassionally it can cause changes in the pathogenicity of the virus. This was quite apparent wih the coronavirus that recently cause a worldwide pandemic. We have seen 4 variants and their various subvariants that have changed the pathogenicity of the virus generally making it easier to spread.

Using the known discovery dates of the different variants we can overlay this with the infection and death counts and rates in order to see how each variant affected the ability of the virus to infect or kill.

As we can see in the plot above the omicron variant was by far the most effective at infection. This in turn increased the amount of deaths but the mortality rate stayed roughly the same telling us that the new variant didnt have an affect on this.
